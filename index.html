<br><br>
<b>Death:</b> N/A (currently age 97)
<br><br>
<b>Summary:</b> Kathleen Booth is credited with creating the assembly language, the ARC (Automatic Relay Computer), the SEC (Simple Electronic Computer), and the APE(X)C (All-purpose Electronic (Rayon) Computer) along with her small team at Birkbeck College in London. She often programmed all the machines that were designed and built (some by her husband, Andrew Booth). 
<br>
Some academic accomplishments include achieving a PhD in applied mathematics, co-founding the School of Computer Science and Information Systems, and publishing a book on the APE(X)C.

<b>Birth:</b> January 31, 1956 in Haarlem, Netherlands
<br><br>
<b>Death:</b> N/A (currently age 63)
<br><br>
<b>Summary:</b> Guido van Rossum is the creator of the easy, yet powerful programming language, Python. Rossum originally released this language in 1991, and it has substantially improved since. It’s used by several universities and big companies worldwide including Google, IBM, and NASA.
<br>
Prior to the invention of his language, he graduated from the University of Amsterdam in 1982 with a master’s degree in mathematics and computer science. In 2006, he was recognized as a Distinguished Engineer by the ACM (Association for Computing Machinery). He currently works for the file hosting service, Dropbox.

<p>
<b>Birth:</b> September 4, 1927 in Boston, MA
<br><br>
<b>Death:</b> October 24, 2011 in Stanford, CA (aged 84) due to heart attack
<br><br>
<b>Summary:</b> John McCarthy is most commonly acknowledged for co-founding Artificial Intelligence (AI), or machines that simulate human intelligence processes. McCarthy received his Bachelor’s degree and Phd in mathematics from California Institute of Technology and Princeton University. He proposed and popularized the idea of timesharing, or the operation of a computer system by several users for different operations at the same time.
<br>
He invented the term “AI” in 1955. Three years later, he created the programming language, Lisp, to refine his ideas about AI. He’s received many prestigious awards for his accomplishments, including the ACM Turing Award (1971), the Kyoto Prize (1988), and the National Medal of Science.

<br><br>
<b>Summary:</b> Larry Page is best known as the co-founder of the popular, worldwide search engine, Google. Page received his Bachelor of Science degree in engineering from the University of Michigan and studied computer engineering at Stanford University. This is where he met Sergey Brin, whom he founded Google with in 1998. Interestingly, the search engine actually began as a college research project between the two in which they listed different websites in order by popularity. 
<br>
In 2015, Page and Brin created a new parent company called Alphabet to oversee Google and other subsidiaries, including YouTube. Larry Page is currently the eighth richest person in the world, with a net worth of $54.4 billion.
