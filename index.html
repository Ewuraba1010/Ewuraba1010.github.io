        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Heyy!! My name is Ewuraba Buckle :). I am currently a 16-year old sophomore at Wheeler High School.<br>
        My parents were both born and raised in Ghana, but my older brothers and I were all born in Kansas. yuck. We soon moved to Georgia though so it's all good.<br>
        Anyways, I'm still kinda new to this coding thing soo I'm not really sure what this website is for at the moment. I'm just trying things out. Nevertheless, I took my first coding class/camp the summer before eighth grade. It was pretty cool. And I took AP Comp Sci Principles last year, soo like I'm basically a pro now. Anyways, I still have a lot to learn but I do know the basics of Java, Python, and HTML now. </p>

    <script> /*javascript*/
        function openTab(evt, tabName) {
          var i, tabcontent, tablinks;
          tabcontent = document.getElementsByClassName("tabcontent");
          for (i = 0; i < tabcontent.length; i++) {
            tabcontent[i].style.display = "none";
          }
          tablinks = document.getElementsByClassName("tablinks");
          for (i = 0; i < tablinks.length; i++) {
            tablinks[i].className = tablinks[i].className.replace(" active", "");
          }
          document.getElementById(tabName).style.display = "block";
          evt.currentTarget.className += " active";
        }
        // Get the element with id="defaultOpen" and click on it
        document.getElementById("defaultOpen").click();
    </script>
